# 2's complement

## binary to decimal 
if msb is 0, convert to decimal as normal.
if msb is 1, $−1\times(~binary +1)$, then convert to decimal

## decimal to binary
if positive, convert to binary as normal
if negative, negate and add 1, the convert to binary.

it's always negate and 1, in that order!

# IEE-754

$(-1)^{sign} \times (1+frac) \times 2^{exp−127}$

**exp** is determined by the 8 bits following the sign bit (as a value in the range 0..255)
**frac** is determined by the least significant 23 bits, negative 2nd powers
